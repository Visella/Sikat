## Overview

### Website Platform Name
Speech Spark

### Mascot Name
Sparkly

### Description

The name of the application we aim to create and develop to achieve our goals and solve the issues we've outlined in the previous sections is Speech Spark. Our application is web-based, making it accessible to users from various electronic devices. Our application will integrate various AI technology features to facilitate user experience and enhance the performance and quality of learning media for users with disabilities. This allows our application to fulfill our motto, "Bersama, Kita Bicara!"

The application has a mascot named Sparkly, a firefly. The choice of this mascot is based on the insect's ability to always shine, even in darkness. This symbolizes individuals with disabilities who always strive in any condition they face. Additionally, our mascot and application have the primary color orange, representing our platform's brand.

## Hackathon Idea

### Topic & Problem Statement
Topic: Communication
<br>
Problem Statement: How to automate speech therapy for individuals with speech disabilities using AI?

### Background of the Problem

To better understand this problem, we provide an overview of the communication issues faced by individuals with disabilities, particularly those with speech difficulties. People with speech disabilities often face challenges in their daily lives, including difficulties in producing clear sounds, using language correctly, understanding others, expressing thoughts or feelings clearly, following conversations, constructing proper sentences, and using appropriate intonation. These challenges can affect their ability to interact effectively with others, leading to social isolation and reduced self-confidence.

According to the 2022 Intercensal Population Survey by the Central Statistics Agency, 1,268,636 people have some difficulty in communication, 310,072 have significant difficulty, and 188,468 cannot communicate at all due to speech impairments. These difficulties can result in social isolation and decreased confidence.

Therefore, we aim to assist individuals with speech disabilities by providing a platform for speech practice or speech therapy. Speech therapy is a process designed to help improve speaking, understanding, and using language more effectively. However, some individuals with disabilities have limited access to speech therapy services due to cost or ineffective therapy methods. These factors can hinder their progress in overcoming speech difficulties. Hence, improving access to speech therapy services for those in need is crucial.

### Solution

#### Here are some objective solutions to address communication issues for individuals with disabilities:
- Provide an affordable and quality platform or medium for speech therapy.
- Integrate AI technology into the application to facilitate learning and communication practice for users.

### Technology and Infrastructure

#### Below is the list of technologies and tools used in developing Speech Spark:

- Programming Languages (Static Website)
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

These three languages are primarily used to develop the front-end static website.

- Tools
  - Figma: Used for creating the framework and overall design of the website application.
  - Microsoft Copilot: Used to assist in generating images for the application logo.
  - GitHub: Used for code storage and repository hosting or deployment on Microsoft Azure.
  - Replit: Used as a medium for real-time collaboration in writing code and developing the front-end website.
  - Visual Studio Code: A coding editor for quickly starting coding with various programming languages.
  - OneDrive: Used as cloud storage for saving and collaborating on various documents.

- AI Development Technologies and Tools (Microsoft Azure)
  - Azure Static Web App
  - Azure Video Indexer (Emotion Detection)
  - Speech Studio (Pronunciation Assessment with Speech to Text + Captioning with Speech to Text)
  - Azure Cognitive Services for Language & Azure Bot integrated with OpenAI

### Conclusion

Based on everything we have written in the previous sections, individuals with speech disabilities will receive a solution in the form of a web-based application called Speech Spark. This application has three main features: Speech Study, Scene Speak, and Spark Bot. It also includes other features and services that are interesting and support the growth of individuals with communication disabilities.

Our hope is that this application will facilitate the needs of individuals in training their communication skills. Efficient, enjoyable, and easily accessible solutions for all are the foundation of Speech Spark.

### Future Plans

#### Here are the future plans for developing the website application:

- Adding Additional Features
  - As mentioned earlier, we plan to add various other features such as Personalized Profile, Community, and Learn Together.

- Integrating AI into all features
  - Currently, our application is in the form of a static web app, so AI integration is not yet significant. We plan to comprehensively and fully integrate AI technology into all supporting features. This includes AI integration in Speech Study, Scene Speak, Personalized Profile, recommending educational videos based on user data, and more.

- Adding back-end to our application
  - We plan to use frameworks like React or Laravel to create a stronger code ecosystem. Application maintenance will also be easier using specific frameworks.

- Adding a database to the Speech Spark website application
  - Currently, our application is not connected to a specific database. We plan to develop our application to connect with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Firebase for better data management.

- Enhancing the use of Microsoft Azure services
  - As previously mentioned, our web application is still under development, and some features are not yet integrated with Azure services. Therefore, to facilitate application development and enhance future features, we plan to integrate our entire web application ecosystem into Microsoft Azure. This includes transforming the static web app into a dynamic web app + database.

- Increasing Speech Spark's brand awareness
  - Using the right promotional strategies, we aim to raise public awareness about communication issues faced by individuals with disabilities. Speech Spark can invite the public to be more aware of communication issues with individuals with disabilities. We aim to reach all individuals with disabilities, including children, teenagers, and adults, to use Speech Spark as an alternative for speech therapy.
